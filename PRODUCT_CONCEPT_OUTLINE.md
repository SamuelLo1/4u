# Personality-Driven Shopping Experience - Product Concept

## High-Level Overview
A personalized shopping experience that uses daily personality assessments to create tailored product recommendations, AI-generated room visualizations, and curated catalogs that evolve with the user over time.

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Personality Assessment
- **First-time user onboarding**
- Present comprehensive personality questionnaire (10-15 questions)
- Questions designed to capture:
  - Lifestyle preferences
  - Aesthetic tastes
  - Values and priorities
  - Shopping behaviors
  - Living situation
  - Color preferences
  - Material preferences (wood, metal, fabric, etc.)

### Phase 2: Personality Processing & Analysis
- **LLM Processing Pipeline**
- Send questionnaire responses to LLM for analysis
- Generate comprehensive personality profile including:
  - Style preferences (minimalist, maximalist, bohemian, modern, etc.)
  - Functional needs assessment
  - Budget considerations
  - Color palette preferences
  - Lifestyle compatibility scores

### Phase 3: Product Recommendation Engine
- **Shopify SDK Integration**
- Use personality profile to query Shopify product catalog
- Filter and rank products based on:
  - Style compatibility
  - Price range alignment
  - Functional relevance
  - User's previous interactions
- Generate curated product list (10-20 items)

### Phase 4: AI Room Visualization
- **Image Generation Pipeline**
- Use personality profile + recommended products to create room visualization
- Generate realistic room mockup featuring:
  - Recommended products in context
  - Color scheme matching personality
  - Spatial arrangement reflecting lifestyle
  - Lighting and atmosphere aligned with preferences
- Multiple room types based on user needs (living room, bedroom, kitchen, etc.)

### Phase 5: Catalog Presentation
- **Interactive Product Showcase**
- Present recommended items in visually appealing catalog format
- Include:
  - AI-generated room as hero image
  - Individual product cards with details
  - "Why this matches you" explanations
  - Easy purchase integration via Shopify
  - Save/wishlist functionality

## Daily Re-evaluation System

### Ongoing Personality Refinement
- **Daily micro-surveys (2-3 questions)**
- Focus on:
  - Mood-based preferences
  - Seasonal adjustments
  - Life changes or events
  - Feedback on previous recommendations
  - New interests or priorities

### Dynamic Updates
- Process daily responses to update personality profile
- Regenerate recommendations based on evolved profile
- Create new room visualization reflecting changes
- Update catalog with fresh product suggestions

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **User Input** → Survey responses
2. **LLM Processing** → Personality analysis
3. **Shopify API** → Product data retrieval
4. **AI Image Generation** → Room visualization
5. **UI Rendering** → Catalog presentation

### Required Integrations
